/*******************************************************************************
 You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping 
 * you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected 
 * and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into 
 * on the same night.
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
* determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 *                  
 * The initalization is obvious:
 *     dp[0] = 0
 *     dp[1] = money[0]
