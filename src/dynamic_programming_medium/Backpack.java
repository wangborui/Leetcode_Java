/**
 * *****************************************************************************
 * Given n items with size Ai, an integer m denotes the size of a backpack. How full you can fill this backpack?
 *
 *
 * You can not divide any item into small pieces.
 *
 * Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
 * Example
 * If we have 4 items with size [2, 3, 5, 7], the backpack size is 11,
 * we can select [2, 3, 5], so that the max size we can fill this backpack is 10.
 * If the backpack size is 12. we can select [2, 3, 7] so that we can fulfill the backpack.
 *
 * You function should return the max size we can fill in the given backpack.
 *
 * Challenge
 * O(n x m) time and O(m) memory.
 *
 * O(n x m) memory is also acceptable if you do not know how to optimize memory.

     * Analysis:
     * Time O(n * m) Space O(m)
     * We know that we have m + 1 possible weights: 0, 1, 2, ... m - 1, m We
     * know that we have n + 1 possible items : item with no weight, first item
     * A[0], second item A[1] and A[n] We need to first create a 2D boolean
     * array with m + 1 rows and n + 1 columns called dp

//     * Defined
//     * 
//     *      dp[i][j] means we can take out all or a few of the first i items, not including the ith item, and have them sum to a max weight of j
//     * 
//     * Initialization
//     * 
//     *      all values in dp are false initially except the first value dp[0][0] is true
//     *      because if our backpack carries 0 weight, then we can take no items out of the back to fulfill it, therefore, first item is possible candidate
//     * 
//     * Optimal function:
//     *      
//     *     $Take the (i - 1)th item     : dp[i - 1][j - A[i - 1]]
//     *      if we take the (i - 1)th item, we need to know the first (i - 1)th items, 0 ... i - 2 can sum to a max weight of j - A[i - 1](current item weight)
//     * 
//     *     $Not take the (i - 1)th item : dp[i - 1][j]
//     *     if we dont take the (i - 1)th item, we need to know the first (i - 1)th items, 0...i - 2 can sum to a max weight of j
//     * 
//     * 
//     *      dp[i][j] = Take the (i - 1)th item || Not take the (i - 1)th item
//     * 
//     * Pitfalls : we have to make sure j - A[j - 1] >= 0 to make sure if we take the i - 1 th item, we dont exceed bag weight limit
