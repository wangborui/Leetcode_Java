 * ********************************************************************************
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,
 * compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 *
 * For example,
 * Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.

 *       0  1   0  2  1   0  1  3  2  1  2  1
 *
 * The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case,
 * 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

/*
 * The idea is:
 *    1) have 2 pointers, left and right. left = 0, right = n - 1. find leftHeight and rightHeight at current index
 *    2) traverse the left pointer from left toward right,
 *       when find a bar lower than height of leftHeight, add the difference in height to total height, this is where water can be trapped in the graph
 *       when find a bar heigher than height of leftHeight, set leftHeight to the new height.  
 *    3) Compare current leftHeight and rightHeight, move the smaller pointer towards the larget one. do the same process for smaller pointer and height until "left" meets "right"
 *       
 *
 * The code below is quite clear!
